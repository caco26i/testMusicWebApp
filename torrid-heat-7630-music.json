There are several such similarities between Metallica's albums Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, and ...And Justice for All. Master of Puppets is also notable for its extensive use of downpicking and its long instrumental section, beginning about three and a half minutes into the song.",

It is one of the band's most popular songs and has remained a permanent live staple since the release of the album, making this the most played song from the album ...And Justice for All. Like \"Fade to Black\", and \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\", the song starts off slow and clean, but as the song goes on, becomes heavier and faster, leading up to a tapping solo by Kirk Hammett, and a dual guitar section by Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield.",
